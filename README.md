# SimpleOSRSMaxSheet
Its a python script that scrapes the OSRS highscores then imports them into an excel file. 

Make sure Python is installed. I am using Python 3.10

Make sure pip is installed on your windows system.

With pip installed, run the following two commands:

  pip install requests
  
  pip install openpyxl
  
  Dont forget to adjust the username variable to the username you want, and also adjust the file path to where you want the excel sheet to be saved. 

To run the script....
Open cmd 
CD to the destination of the .py script
run the following cmd: python .\OSRSScraper.py
